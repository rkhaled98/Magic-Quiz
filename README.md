# Lab 2 - BuzzFeed Quiz

## What worked?

Logically, everything worked perfectly. It was pretty seamless to go from the hard-coded HTML to abstracted out JavaScript generated HTML with template literals. 

## What didn't work?

- I had some issues getting the fourth display state (when one answer is chosen all other answers should change to a not-selected state (different from the initial no answer chosen state) to work and finally ended up using a (working) hacky JavaScript solution that I hope to gain feedback on and improve.
- I think my quiz looks pretty ugly, not sure how to make background images for questions look good other than by editing images with an external editor that have the correct dimensions.


## Screencap

Used CSS animations with @keyframes to transform the image on hover up to scale of 1.1x for a nice, smooth animation up.
